# get_words_from_dic

I made this repo to try and beat my wife at Wordscapes.  I suck a spelling so she easily beats me.  This means I have to use a little help from the dictionary when she isn't looking. 

To ge the dictionary and metadata:
```
$ wget https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/raw/master/en/en_US.dic
```

```
wget https://github.com/LibreOffice/dictionaries/raw/master/en/en_US.aff
```
